## Calculator

A basic calculator written with Javascript (ES2015), React.js & Redux.

It doesn't do anything special, beyond what a normal calculator does.  It's just a simple demo to show how the technologies work together.

### Development

To try this out, run `npm install`.  Then run `npm run build`.  Now open `index.html` in your browser.

### Demo
